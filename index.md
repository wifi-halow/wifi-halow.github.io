## 4TU Workshop on WiFi HaLow (16 December 2021, 9:00 - 11:10 am CET)

<p><strong>Welcome to the 4TU Workshop on WiFi HaLow (i.e., the long-range WiFi)!</strong></p>

WiFi is dominating the wireless local area networks. To make it also a competitive technology for the next-generation Internet of Things (IoT), <strong>WiFi HaLow</strong> with distinct new IoT features has been released by WiFi Alliance and has attracted extensive attention. Like other IoT technologies such as LoRa and NB-IoT, WiFi HaLow is long-range (>1 km) and low-power. Meanwhile, HaLow can offer a much higher data rate (e.g., >100x at 1 km distance), native IP support, and can be seamlessly integrated into the pervasively existing WiFi access points without extra deployment cost. Operating at the sub-GHz frequency spectrum band, WiFi HaLow increases the traditional WiFi ubiquity, making it suitable for intelligent IoT applications such as smart cities and precision agriculture.

In this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4TU">4TU</a> Workshop on WiFi HaLow, we invite four well-known European researchers and industrial leaders on WiFi HaLow as well as open-source WiFi prototyping to share their latest research findings, insights, and commercialization results, and experience. We aim to bring together researchers to discuss and brainstorm the future opportunities and challenges of the promising long-range WiFi HaLow technology. 

<strong>Come and join us by registering <a href="https://www.4tu.nl/nirict/">here</a>!</strong> If you cannot open the registration link, you could email your name + affiliation to qing.wang@tudelft.nl and qingzhi.liu@wur.nl with the prefix “[4TU HaLow Workshop]”.

This workshop is sponsored by <a href="https://www.4tu.nl/nirict/">4TU.NIRICT</a> through the project “Intelligent Long-range Wi-Fi”.
